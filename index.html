                                    <p>It is a great way to get out all your energy in the last week of school and a great way to catch upp with friends as it is a social event as well as a compeditive event where we show good sportsmanship and resilience. This event is fun and good exersise. Most of our school students advance in sports and express their love for sport by applying for district trials with smiles on the faces and trying their best at getting in to it. All of our students like this event more than others because it is a time where you can see and cheer on your friends and even go up against them which is quite fun. Our whole school would choose to do this instead of any other event that has taken place at this school!</p>
